                    <p>Snow. The one word that best describes winter in Yuzawa. Feet and feet of snow fall to blanket the city for a long, dark winter, but with warm locals and hot sake, you just might survive.</p>

                    <p>Kiritanpo is a delicious, hot broth full of winter vegetables, meat, and the all important mashed rice sticks! A perfect soup to warm anyone up throughout a bleak winter trapped indoor.</p>

                    <p>One of the first flowers to greet Yuzawa are the famous cherry blossoms. The best way to enjoy these delicate, pink blossoms is to view them while picnicking and drinking local sake. Everything pairs well with sake.</p>

                    <p>At the edge of Yuzawa are forests of cherry farms, but don't be fooled, these cherries don't come from the cherry blossoms. You can buy these cherries at any local store or you can sit under a tree and eat until you burst!</p>

                    <p>The perfect way to enjoy the cool summer nights is to gather your friends together and have a traditional Japanese BBQ. On small skewers, you put meats and local vegetables that you cook over a low fire. It takes time, but with good friends and good drink, the nights always end too quickly.</p>
